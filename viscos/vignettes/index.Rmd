# Guide

```{r, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("figures/icon_viscos.png")
```

This is the guide and definition of **visCOS**. 

visCOS stands for "visual comparison of observations and simulations".
The package is still changing quite often. We therefore recommend to not use it 
yet.
