```{r setup3, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE)
```

This section defines the code of a [shiny gadget](http://shiny.rstudio.com/). It enables the interactive exploration of (hydro-) graphs for the different basins.
The gadget shows always the corresponding objective function for the selected graph. Furthermore, one can get the selected data by clicking on "done" at the end of a session. The following examples provide a good overview of what the function can do.

## Example
This chapter gives examples of `judge_explore`. For the pre-requirements take a look at the [introduction](LP-Introduction).
Running the `judge_explore` function without any options opens a shiny gadget in the viewer:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics('figures/judge_explore.jpg')
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("figures/judge_explore.gif")
}
```

Information on the *objective functions* can be found[here](ex-OF_explanation.html). 

Users can select different basins via the selection box (*# basins:*) on the
top-left and interactively zoom and move the graph in the center by clicking
on it or moving the date switches below the graph. While doing so the
objective functions (presented in the table below) are re-calculated for the
chosen time window.

```{r, purl=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
viscos_options(color_o = "green", color_s = "red")
judge(runoff_example,explore)
```
