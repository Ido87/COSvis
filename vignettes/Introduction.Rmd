visCOS is still under (heavy) development, so it is not recommended to use the
package, yet. If you want to do it nevertheless...

visCOS is an R-package that provides summaries and visualisation to support
parameter estimation for conceptual rainfall-runoff models in general and
COSERO in special. COSERO is a hbv-like model that was developed at the
institue for water management, hydrology and hydraulic engineering (IWHW) at
BOKU, Vienna. The name is an abreviation for "**Co**nceptual
**Se**mi-Distributed **R**ainfall Run**o**ff Model".
This page provides a hub to access the differnet examples and the entire program
code.
