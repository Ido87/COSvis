visCOS is still under (heavy) development, so it is not recommended to use the
package, yet. If you want to do it nevertheless...

visCOS is an R-package that provides summaries and visualisation to support
parameter estimation for conceptual rainfall-runoff models in general and
COSERO in special. COSERO is a hbv-like model that was developed at the
institue for water management, hydrology and hydraulic engineering (IWHW) at
BOKU, Vienna. The name is an abreviation for "**Co**nceptual
**Se**mi-Distributed **R**ainfall Run**o**ff Model".
This page provides a hub to access the differnet examples and the entire program
code.

## Loading raw data
From the point of view of **visCOS** raw-data are time-series of observations
and model output. Usually raw data is saved in some simple file format,
e.g. *.txt* or *.csv*. `R` already includes many option to read those files
with the `read.table` functionalities.
For larger unstructured files the read options of the `data.table` package is 
recommended. In our tests it was fastest and most flexible option.
Alternatively the `readr` can be used if the data is more structured and large.

**Note** at this stage, only a comparison between **numbered catchments** 
 for two parameters is possible. So the data must include an integer 
number after the description (like "QObs_001" and "QSim_001").
