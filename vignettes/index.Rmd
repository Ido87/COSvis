visCOS (*vis*ual *c*omparison of *o*bservations and *s*imulations) is still under (heavy) development. It is thus not recommended to use the package, yet.

There exist many hydrological R-packages.

Among them there are several that have the goal of providing aid to the calibration of hydrological models. In particular: The [`hydroGOF`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hydroGOF) packages provides a set of commonly used (and disputed) objective functions. The [`hydroTSM`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hydroTSM) package allows for the analysis, interpolation and plotting of hydrological time series. Topically, **visCOS** can be positioned between those two. In concrete, visCOS is an R-package that provides summaries and visualisation to aid the parameter estimation for conceptual rainfall-runoff models in general and COSERO in special.
COSERO is a HBV-like model that was developed at the
institute for water management, hydrology and hydraulic engineering (IWHW) at
BOKU, Vienna. The name is an abbreviation for "**Co**nceptual
**Se**mi-Distributed **R**ainfall Run**o**ff Model".
This page provides a hub to access the different examples and the entire program
code.
