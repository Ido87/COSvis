This is documentation and code for the R-package **visCOS**. **visCOS** stands
for  *vis*ual *c*omparison of *o*bservations and *s*imulations. The package is
still under (heavy) development and we therefore do not recommended to use the package, yet.

There exist many R-packages dedicated to hydrology.

Among then, several have provide help to the calibration of (conceptual)
rainfall-runoff models. As their name suggests, these models relate the a
rainfall input to a generated runoff for some given basins They have found
a wide array of applications in hydrology. Form the analysis of catchment
properties to climate impact studies, so to speak. From the point o view of the
R package ecosystem there are to packages, which are of particular interest with
regard to **visCOS**:
The [`hydroGOF`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hydroGOF) package and the
[`hydroTSM`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hydroTSM) package. The former
provides the most commonly used (and discussed) objective functions. The
latter, helps with the analysis, interpolation and the plotting of hydrological
time series.

As an R-package that aim of **visCOS** is to provide summaries - in a visual
and numerical sense - to aid a concurrent and comparative parameter estimation
for multiple (related) basins or catchments. Topic wise, **visCOS** might
therefore be positioned somewhere in-between the two previously mentioned
packages. **visCOS** is usable for conceptual rainfall runoff models
in general, but almost all of its functionality has been derived from different
applications of the COSERO model. COSERO is a HBV-like distributed
rainfall-runoff model, developed at the institute for water management,
hydrology and hydraulic engineering at BOKU, Vienna. The name is an abbreviation
for "**Co**nceptual **Se**mi-Distributed **R**ainfall Run**o**ff Model".
