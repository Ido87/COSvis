Here you can find the documentation and code for the R-package **visCOS**. 

**visCOS** stands for  *vis*ual *c*omparison of *o*bservations and *s*imulations. 
The aim of the package is to provide summaries that help with the basin-wide calibration 
of the hydrological model COSERO (and its derivatives). 

COSERO is a HBV-like, semi-distributed
rainfall-runoff model, developed at the institute for water management,
hydrology and hydraulic engineering at BOKU, Vienna. The name is an abbreviation
for "**Co**nceptual **Se**mi-Distributed **R**ainfall Run**o**ff Model

This package is still under (heavy) development and we therefore 
do not recommended to use the package, yet!

In the `R` ecosystem there already exist several packages which help with 
the calibration of rainfall-runoff models. Mentioning them all here would be 
to much. Instead we would like to point out two particular packages; 

The [`hydroGOF`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hydroGOF) package and the
[`hydroTSM`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hydroTSM) package. The former
provides the most commonly used (and discussed) objective functions. The
latter, helps with the analysis, interpolation and the plotting of hydrological
time series.Topic wise, **visCOS** might be positioned somewhere in-between 
the those two.

The package is usable for conceptual rainfall runoff models
in general, but almost all of its functionality has been derived from different
applications of the COSERO.
